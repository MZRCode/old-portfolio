# 💻 Portfolio Website
This is the open-source code of my **previous portfolio website**. After designing and launching my new site, I decided to share the old one with the community it might serve as a great starting point or source of inspiration for your own personal website.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I used [MiyagawaMizu/card](https://github.com/MiyagawaMizu/card) as a reference when getting started.
